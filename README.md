#### Assistance Work 
Each day perform _one_ exercise from each category listed below. Perform 50-100 total reps (do whatever sets you want to perform - that doesn't matter) of each exercise. If you are too weak to get all the reps (chin-ups/pull-ups for example) then simply choose a _second_ movement to complete the total reps. 

_Push:_ Dips, push-ups, dumbbell bench press, triceps extensions  

_Pull:_ Chin-ups, pull-ups, inverted rows, rows, face pulls, lat pulldown, curls  

_Core:_ Any abdominal work
